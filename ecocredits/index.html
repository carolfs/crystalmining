    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>On your quest, you’ll encounter five unique crystals each day. Some are small and delicate, emitting a soft glow, while others are massive and radiant, their facets reflecting the light of nearby stars.</p>

        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Each crystal is worth a different number of points depending on its size and properties. As a C3 employee, you are equipped with a high-tech crystal scanner that displays the point value of each crystal you encounter.</p>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>When you come across a crystal, you can choose to collect or discard it. If you collect the crystal, you instantly earn the points displayed on your scanner.</p>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>If you come across a crystal and discard it, no points will be added to your score. You may choose to discard a crystal for reasons that will be explained later.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Throughout the day, you’ll use your scanner to keep track of your daily <strong>crystal score,</strong> the points you’ve earned that day from collecting crystals. For example, let’s say that today you’ve already collected two crystals worth 45 points in total. So, your current crystal score is 45 points.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
          class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>
      <li class="expscreen">
          <p>Imagine your scanner displays a new crystal worth 20 points. If you decide to discard it, your crystal score stays at 45 points &mdash; the number shown in the DISCARD box. In other words, the DISCARD box displays your crystal score if you choose to discard the crystal.</p>

      </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The COLLECT box shows what your new crystal score will be if you decide to collect this crystal. It shows 65 points because it adds the new crystal’s 20 points to your current 45 points.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Your overall <strong>game score</strong>, displayed in the top left corner of your helmet’s heads-up display, keeps track of your total earnings from every day of working as a crystal miner. When you collect a crystal, its point value is instantly added to your game score.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>However, crystal mining is not without its challenges. The Intergalactic Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) has long been concerned about the impact of mining on the delicate ecosystems of Zyxlon.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>IEPA has implemented the Stellar Sustainability Initiative to encourage eco-friendly mining practices on planet Zyxlon. This program rewards miners with bonus points called Eco-Credits, which are added to their game scores.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The number of Eco-Credits you receive depends on your daily crystal score. Lower crystal scores generally result in higher Eco-Credits because they indicate less intensive mining, which is better for the planet.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>However, higher crystal scores suggest more intensive mining, which is harmful to Zyxlon’s environment. This may result in fewer Eco-Credits or even a penalty (negative Eco-Credits).</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Your local Eco-Credit Auditor, a quirky and unpredictable character, is responsible for calculating the Eco-Credits for all the miners at C3.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/auditor.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The exact way they calculate the Eco-Credits is kept a secret, and they purposely introduce some variation into the process, keeping miners on their toes. In some cases, you might receive unexpectedly high Eco-Credits, while your colleague with a similar crystal score may receive less.</p>
    <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/ecocrd.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
  </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The Auditor’s mood and feelings can affect how many Eco-Credits you receive, but only to a certain degree. The general principle still applies: higher crystal scores tend to result in fewer Eco-Credits, while lower crystal scores usually lead to more Eco-Credits.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/ecocrd.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>When you get a very high crystal score, the Auditor may give you a negative number of Eco-Credit points, meaning you’ll lose points instead of gaining them. This is because high crystal scores can cause significant environmental damage, and the Eco-Credit system is designed to discourage such practices.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/ecocrd.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The Auditor, for all their eccentricities, is completely impartial when it comes to which miner is receiving the Eco-Credits. In the Eco-Credit calculation system, a miner’s identity is kept anonymous, and the Auditor has no way of knowing whose points they are calculating.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/ecocrd.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>After a long day of crystal hunting, you’ll have the chance to participate in the Eco-Credit prediction mini-game, a
        favourite pastime among the miners of C3.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The Eco-Credit prediction mini-game was created because the miners of C3 were frustrated with the confusing Eco-Credit system on planet Zyxlon, so they decided to make a game out of it. This way, they could have some fun while also learning how the Eco-Credits worked.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Using your knowledge of the crystal market and Eco-Credit calculations, you’ll try to predict your own Eco-Credits and those
        of
        your colleagues. The more accurate your predictions are, the more points you’ll earn, up to 10 points per
        prediction.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Before you choose to collect or discard the fifth crystal of the day, you will be asked to predict your Eco-Credits.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/ecocredits/img/crystal5_predict.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To do this, you’ll see the point value of the fifth crystal and what your crystal score for the day will be if
        you choose
        to collect or discard it. When you see this screen, decide if you’ll collect this crystal or not. This is because you need to know your final end-of-day crystal score to accurately predict your Eco-Credits.</p>

      <p>Then, you’ll move to the Eco-Credit prediction screen. Information about the fifth crystal will be at the top right of

        <ol>
          <li>The Auditor will definitely give Celestine and Sirius the exact same number of Eco-Credits because they
            don’t play favourites</li>
          <li>The Auditor will give Celestine more Eco-Credits than Sirius because Celestine has worked for C3 longer</li>

          <li class="correct">The Auditor has no way to tell Celestine and Sirius apart, but their Eco-Credits will likely
            be

          <li>The decision to collect or discard the fifth crystal has no impact on the Eco-Credit calculation, as the Eco-Credits are solely based on the first four crystals you’ve encountered</li>
