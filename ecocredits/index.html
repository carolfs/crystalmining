      <p>These crystals, coveted across the universe for their extraordinary healing properties, are sold on the

      <p>Each working day, you’ll board your state-of-the-art spaceship, the Celestial Cruiser X9, and set course for

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>On your quest, you’ll encounter five unique crystals each day. Some are small and delicate, emitting a soft glow, while others are massive and radiant, their facets reflecting the light of nearby stars.</p>
      <img src="img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Each crystal is worth a varying amount of money depending on its size and properties. As a C3 employee, you are equipped with a high-tech crystal scanner that displays the value in pence of each crystal you encounter.</p>
      <img src="img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="img/crystal_points.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>When you come across a crystal, you can choose to collect or discard it. If you collect the crystal, you instantly earn the value displayed on your scanner, which increases the payment you will receive for your participation.</p>
      <img src="img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="img/crystal_points.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>If you come across a crystal and discard it, your payment will stay the same. You may choose to discard a crystal for reasons that will be explained later.</p>
      <img src="img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Throughout the day, you’ll use your scanner to keep track of your <strong>daily crystal payment,</strong> the amount of money you’ve earned that day from collecting crystals. For example, let’s say that today you’ve already collected two crystals worth 3.00p in total. So, your daily crystal payment is currently 3.00p.</p>
      <img src="img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
          class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>
      <li class="expscreen">
          <p>Imagine your scanner displays a new crystal worth 0.44p. If you decide to discard it, your daily crystal payment stays at 3.00p &mdash; the number shown in the DISCARD box. In other words, the DISCARD box displays your daily crystal payment if you choose to discard the crystal.</p>
        <img src="img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
          class="instructions_illustration">
        <img src="img/arrow_discard.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
      </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The COLLECT box shows what your new crystal payment will be if you decide to collect this crystal. It shows 3.44p points because it adds the new crystal’s 0.44p to your current 3.00p.</p>
      <img src="img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Your overall payment is displayed in the top left corner of your helmet’s heads-up display. It keeps track of your total earnings from every day of working as a crystal miner. For participating in this experiment, you’ll receive this amount or a minimum of £<span class="constant BASE_PAYMENT"></span>.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>However, crystal mining is not without its challenges. The Intergalactic Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) has long been concerned about the impact of mining on the delicate ecosystems of Zyxlon.</p>
      <img src="img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>IEPA has implemented the Stellar Sustainability Initiative to encourage eco-friendly mining practices on planet Zyxlon. This program rewards miners with bonus payments called Eco-Credits.</p>
      <img src="img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The amount of Eco-Credits you receive depends on your daily crystal payment. Lower daily crystal payments generally result in higher Eco-Credits because they indicate less intensive mining, which is better for the planet.</p>
      <img src="img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>However, higher daily crystal payments suggest more intensive mining, which is harmful to Zyxlon’s environment. This may result in fewer Eco-Credits or even a penalty (negative Eco-Credits).</p>
      <img src="img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Your local Eco-Credit Auditor, a quirky and unpredictable character, is responsible for calculating the Eco-Credits for all the miners at C3.</p>
      <img src="img/auditor.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The exact way they calculate the Eco-Credits is kept a secret, and they purposely introduce some variation into the process, keeping miners on their toes.</p>
    <img src="img/ecocrd.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
  </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The Auditor’s mood and feelings can affect how many Eco-Credits you receive, but only to a certain degree. The general principle still applies: higher daily crystal payments tend to result in fewer Eco-Credits, while lower daily crystal payments usually lead to more Eco-Credits.</p>
      <img src="img/ecocrd.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>When you earn a very high crystal payment in a day, the Auditor may give you negative Eco-Credits, meaning you’ll lose money instead of gaining any. This is because high daily crystal payments can cause significant environmental damage, which the Eco-Credit system is designed to discourage.</p>
      <img src="img/ecocrd.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The Auditor, for all their eccentricities, is completely impartial when it comes to which miner is receiving the Eco-Credits. In the Eco-Credit calculation system, a miner’s identity is kept anonymous, and the Auditor has no way of knowing whose payment they are calculating.</p>
      <img src="img/ecocrd.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>After a long day of crystal hunting, you’ll have the chance to participate in the Eco-Credit prediction mini-game, a
        favourite pastime among the miners of C3.</p>
      <img src="img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The Eco-Credit prediction mini-game was created because the miners of C3 were frustrated with the confusing Eco-Credit system on planet Zyxlon, so they decided to make a game out of it. This way, they could have some fun while also learning how the Eco-Credits worked.</p>
      <img src="img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Using your knowledge of the crystal market and Eco-Credit calculations, you’ll try to predict your own Eco-Credits and those
        of
        your colleagues. The more accurate your predictions are, the more money you’ll earn, up to <span class="constant MAX_PREDICTION_POINTS"></span>p per
        prediction.</p>
      <img src="img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Before you choose to collect or discard the fifth crystal of the day, you will be asked to predict your Eco-Credits.</p>
      <img src="img/crystal5_predict.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To do this, you’ll see the value of the fifth crystal and what your crystal payment for the day will be if
        you choose
        to collect or discard it. When you see this screen, decide if you’ll collect this crystal or not. This is because you need to know your final end-of-day crystal payment to accurately predict your Eco-Credits.</p>
        <img src="img/crystal5_predict.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Then, you’ll move to the Eco-Credit prediction screen. Information about the fifth crystal will be at the top right of
        the
        screen, helping you predict your Eco-Credits.</p>
        <img src="img/own_prediction.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Next, you can also earn up to <span class="constant MAX_PREDICTION_POINTS"></span>p for predicting a colleague’s Eco-Credits based on their crystal
        collection.</p>

      <p>The key to earning money in this game is to make a good profit from collecting crystals while balancing your environmental impact to optimise your total daily payment (crystal payment + Eco-Credits). Remember: your in-game earnings will be paid out to you at the end of the experiment.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The Eco-Credits will be a fixed percentage (e.g., 10&percnt;) of their daily crystal payment</li>
          <li class="correct">The Auditor generally awards more Eco-Credits for lower daily crystal payments.</li>
          <li>The Eco-Credits are calculated from the number of collected crystals</li>

          <li>Miner Avery Solstice, who collected crystals worth a total of 75p</li>
          <li>Miner Remy Nova, who collected crystals worth a total of 50p</li>

      <li class="expscreen">If two miners, Celestine and Sirius, have the exact same crystal payment for the day, will their
        Eco-Credits be calculated differently?
        <ol>
          <li>The Auditor will definitely give Celestine and Sirius the exact same amount in Eco-Credits because they
            don’t play favourites</li>
          <li>The Auditor will give Celestine more Eco-Credits than Sirius because Celestine has worked for C3 longer</li>
          <li>The Auditor will purposely give one of them fewer Eco-Credits based on whose personal life they dislike more
          </li>
          <li class="correct">The Auditor has no way to tell Celestine and Sirius apart, but their Eco-Credits will likely
            be
            different because Eco-Credit calculations are a bit unpredictable</li>

      <li class="expscreen">Each working day, before collecting or discarding the fifth crystal, you must predict your Eco-Credits. What should you do before moving to the Eco-Credit prediction screen?

          <li>Calculate the average value of the crystals collected that day</li>

      <li class="expscreen">Why is it important to decide whether to collect or discard the fifth crystal before
        predicting
        your Eco-Credits?
        <ol>
          <li>Because the Auditor will ignore the fifth crystal when calculating your Eco-Credits</li>
          <li class="correct">Because you need to know your final crystal payment to estimate your Eco-Credits, and this
            requires deciding if you’ll collect or discard the fifth crystal</li>
          <li>Because the Auditor will base your Eco-Credits only on your decision to collect or discard the fifth
            crystal</li>
          <li>Because you need to know the rarity of the fifth crystal to predict your Eco-Credits</li>

      <li class="expscreen">You have already collected four crystals, giving you a daily crystal payment of 100p. The fifth crystal you’ve found is worth 30p. Before collecting or discarding this crystal, you must predict your Eco-Credits for the day. If you decide to <strong>collect</strong> the fifth crystal, what crystal payment should you use to predict your Eco-Credits?
        <ol>
          <li>100p</li>
          <li class="correct">130p</li>
          <li>30p</li>
          <li>The Eco-Credits are not based on your daily crystal payment</li>

      <li class="expscreen">You encounter the fifth crystal, which is worth 40p. The DISCARD box shows 80p, and the COLLECT box shows 120p. Which of the following statements is true?
        <ol>
          <li>The decision to collect or discard the fifth crystal has no impact on the Eco-Credit calculation, as the Eco-Credits are based on the first four crystals you’ve encountered</li>
          <li>If you collect the fifth crystal, you are likely to receive more Eco-Credits compared to discarding it because a crystal payment of 120p suggests eco-friendly mining practices</li>
          <li>If you collect the fifth crystal, you are likely to receive more Eco-Credits compared to discarding it as a reward for collecting more crystals</li>
          <li class="correct">If you collect the fifth crystal, you are likely to receive fewer Eco-Credits compared to discarding it because a crystal payment of 120p is worse for Zyxlon’s environment than 80p</li>
