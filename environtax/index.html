      <p>It is the year 2452. As an employee of the renowned Cosmic Crystal Corp (C3), your mission is to fly every day
        to planet Zyxlon to collect the most valuable and powerful healing crystals in the galaxy.</p>

        class="instructions_illustration">

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Each working day, you’ll board your state-of-the-art spaceship, the Celestial Cruiser X9, and set course for
        Zyxlon.</p>

        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>On your quest, you’ll encounter five unique crystals each day. Some crystals are small and delicate, emitting a
        soft, soothing glow, while others are massive and radiant, their facets reflecting the light of nearby stars.
      </p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Each crystal is worth a different number of points depending on their size and properties. You must choose
        which
        crystals to collect and which to discard.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Throughout the day, you’ll use your high-tech scanning device to keep track of your crystal score, the points
        you’ve earned
        that day from collecting crystals. The DISCARD box displays your crystal score if you choose to discard the
        current
        crystal. In the example screen below, it’s 45 points.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">

    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The COLLECT box shows your updated crystal score if you decide to add the crystal to your collection. For
        example, the crystal below is worth 20 points, so if you choose to collect it, your crystal score will increase
        from 45 to 65 points.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">

    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Your overall score, displayed in the top left corner of your helmet’s heads-up display, represents your
        cumulative points across all
        working days.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/arrow_score.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>However, crystal mining is not without its challenges. The Intergalactic Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
        has
        long been concerned about the impact of mining on the delicate ecosystems of Zyxlon.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To mitigate this harm, all miners are required to pay daily taxes based on the number of crystal points they’ve
        collected. Your local tax officer, a quirky and unpredictable character, is responsible for calculating taxes
        for
        all the miners at C3.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/taxofficer.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>While the general principle is that the more crystal points you collect, the higher your taxes will be, there
        is
        some variation in how the tax officer applies this rule. Their methods are not entirely transparent, and they
        seem to
        enjoy adding a bit of randomness to the process, keeping miners on their toes.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You might find that your taxes are lower than expected on a day when you’ve collected a particularly large haul
        of
        crystals, while your colleague, with a similar collection, may end up paying more. The tax officer’s moods and
        whims
        can influence the tax rates, but only to a certain degree.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>It's important to note that even if you collect zero crystal points on a given day, you are likely to pay a
        tax. This is because the tax includes a daily fee for the right to mine on Zyxlon. The tax officer will add the
        daily fee to any taxes incurred based on your crystal score to calculate your tax payment.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>After a long day of crystal hunting, you’ll have the chance to participate in the tax prediction mini-game, a
        favorite pastime among the miners of C3.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The tax prediction mini-game was born out of the shared experience of navigating the frustrating tax system on
        planet Zyxlon. They reasoned that if they were going to be subject to the tax officer’s whimsical
        decisions, they might as well make a game out of it.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The tax prediction mini-game also serves a practical purpose, as it encourages miners to develop a better
        understanding of how the tax system works and make more informed decisions about their own mining strategies.
      </p>
    <img src="/crystalmining/img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Using your knowledge of the crystal market and tax calculations, you’ll try to predict your own taxes and those
        of
        your colleagues. The more accurate your predictions are, the more points you’ll earn, up to 10 points per
        prediction.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Before you choose to collect or discard the fifth crystal of the day, you will be asked to predict your tax
        payment.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/crystal5_predict_taxes.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To do this, you’ll see the point value of the fifth crystal and what your crystal score for the day will be if
        you choose
        to collect or discard it. When you see this screen, decide if you’ll collect this crystal or not.</p>
        <img src="/crystalmining/img/crystal5_predict_taxes.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Then, you’ll move to the tax prediction screen. Information about the fifth crystal will be at the top right of
        the
        screen, helping you predict the tax payment.</p>
        <img src="/crystalmining/img/own_tax_prediction.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You can earn up to 10 points for predicting your taxes, and these points will be added to your overall score.
        The
        more accurate your prediction, the more points you will earn.</p>
        <img src="/crystalmining/img/own_tax_prediction_results.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Next, you can also earn up to 10 points for predicting a colleague’s tax payment based on their crystal
        collection,
        and these points will be added to your overall score.</p>
        <img src="/crystalmining/img/colleague_tax_prediction.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To become the ultimate space miner and maximize your score, you’ll need to find the perfect balance between
        collecting valuable crystals and avoiding excessive taxes.</p>
        <img src="/crystalmining/img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Study the patterns of your colleagues’ crystal collections and tax payments, and use this knowledge to refine
        your
        strategy. The key to success is to collect as many crystal points as possible while keeping your taxes
        manageable, a
        delicate balance that requires skill, intuition, and a bit of cosmic luck.</p>
        <img src="/crystalmining/img/colleague_tax_prediction_results.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Next, you’ll play the game for <span class="constant NUM_TRIALS"></span> rounds. Each round corresponds to a

        This will happen automatically. You don’t have to press any keys.</p>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Then you will choose whether to collect or discard five crystals, just like you practised earlier. Before you
