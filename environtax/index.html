      <p>It is the year 2452. As an employee of Cosmic Crystal Corp (C3), your mission is to fly daily
        to planet Zyxlon to collect the most valuable crystals in the galaxy.</p>

      <p>These crystals, coveted across the universe for their extraordinary healing properties, are sold on the
        Intergalactic Market for profit.</p>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Each working day, you’ll board your state-of-the-art spaceship, the Celestial Cruiser X9, and set course for
        Zyxlon.</p>
      <img src="img/sky_planet.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">

        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>On your quest, you’ll encounter five unique crystals each day. Some are small and delicate, emitting a soft glow, while others are massive and radiant, their facets reflecting the light of nearby stars.</p>
      <img src="img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Each crystal is worth a different number of points depending on their size and properties. As a C3 employee, you are equipped with a high-tech crystal scanner that displays the point value of each crystal you encounter.</p>
      <img src="img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="img/crystal_points.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>When you come across a crystal, you can choose to collect or discard it. If you collect the crystal, you instantly earn the points displayed on your scanner.</p>
      <img src="img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="img/crystal_points.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>If you come across a crystal and discard it, no points will be added to your score. You may choose to discard a crystal for reasons that will be explained later.</p>
      <img src="img/crystals_unique.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="img/crystal_points.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Throughout the day, you’ll use your scanner to keep track of your <strong>crystal score,</strong> the points you’ve earned that day from collecting crystals. The number displayed in the DISCARD box represents your current crystal score from collecting crystals earlier that day, before you encountered the crystal being shown. In the example below, it’s 45 points.</p>
      <img src="img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="img/arrow_discard.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The COLLECT box shows your updated crystal score if you decide to add the crystal to your collection. For example, the crystal below is worth 20 points, so if you choose to collect it, your crystal score will increase from 45 to 65 points.</p>
      <img src="img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="img/arrow_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Your overall score, displayed in the top left corner of your helmet’s heads-up display, keeps track of your total earnings and spending from every day of working as a crystal miner.</p>
      <img src="img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt=""
        class="instructions_illustration">
      <img src="img/arrow_score.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>However, crystal mining is not without its challenges. The Intergalactic Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) has long been concerned about the impact of mining on the delicate ecosystems of Zyxlon.</p>
      <img src="img/zyxlon.jpg" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To mitigate this harm, all miners are required to pay daily taxes based on their crystal score. Your local tax officer, a quirky and unpredictable character, is responsible for calculating taxes for all the miners at C3.</p>
      <img src="img/taxofficer.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>In principle, miners who collect more crystal points will generally pay higher taxes. It doesn’t matter if you got that score from collecting a few very valuable crystals or many smaller ones.</p>
      <img src="img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>But there is some variation in how the tax officer applies this principle. The way they calculate taxes is kept a secret, and they purposely make it a bit random, keeping miners on their toes.</p>
    <img src="img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
  </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You might find that your taxes are unexpectedly low on a day when you’ve gotten a high crystal score, while your colleague, with a similar score, may end up paying more. The tax officer’s mood and feelings can affect how much tax they charge, but only to a certain degree.</p>
      <img src="img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">

    <li class="expscreen">

      <img src="img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Watch out for getting a very high crystal score. The tax officer may charge you exorbitant taxes because this causes severe environmental harm, and you may end up losing most of your profit to heavy taxes for that day.</p>
      <img src="img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
  </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The tax officer, for all their eccentricities, is completely impartial when it comes to which miner is paying the taxes. In the tax calculation system, a miner’s identity is kept anonymous, and the officer has no way of knowing whose taxes they are calculating.</p>
      <img src="img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Note that even if you collect zero crystal points on a given day, you are likely to pay a
        tax. This is because the tax includes a daily fee for the right to mine on Zyxlon.</p>
      <img src="img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>After a long day of crystal hunting, you’ll have the chance to participate in the tax prediction mini-game, a
        favourite pastime among the miners of C3.</p>
      <img src="img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The tax prediction mini-game was created because the miners of C3 were frustrated with the confusing tax system on planet Zyxlon, so they decided to make a game out of it. This way, they could have some fun while also learning how the taxes worked.</p>
      <img src="img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Using your knowledge of the crystal market and tax calculations, you’ll try to predict your own taxes and those
        of
        your colleagues. The more accurate your predictions are, the more points you’ll earn, up to 10 points per
        prediction.</p>
      <img src="img/mini_game.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Before you choose to collect or discard the fifth crystal of the day, you will be asked to predict your tax
        payment.</p>
      <img src="img/crystal5_predict_taxes.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To do this, you’ll see the point value of the fifth crystal and what your crystal score for the day will be if
        you choose
        to collect or discard it. When you see this screen, decide if you’ll collect this crystal or not. This is because you need to know your final end-of-day crystal score to accurately predict your tax payment.</p>
        <img src="img/crystal5_predict_taxes.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Then, you’ll move to the tax prediction screen. Information about the fifth crystal will be at the top right of
        the
        screen, helping you predict the tax payment.</p>
        <img src="img/own_tax_prediction.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You can earn up to 10 points for predicting your taxes, and these points will be added to your overall score.
        The
        more accurate your prediction, the more points you will earn.</p>
        <img src="img/own_tax_prediction_results.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Next, you can also earn up to 10 points for predicting a colleague’s tax payment based on their crystal
        collection,
        and these points will be added to your overall score.</p>
        <img src="img/colleague_tax_prediction.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To become the ultimate space miner and maximize your score, you’ll need to find the perfect balance between
        collecting valuable crystals and avoiding excessive taxes.</p>
        <img src="img/tax_outcome.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">
    </li>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Study the patterns of your colleagues’ crystal collections and tax payments, and use this knowledge to refine
        your
        strategy. The key to success is to collect as many crystal points as possible while keeping your taxes
        manageable, a
        delicate balance that requires skill, intuition, and a bit of cosmic luck.</p>
        <img src="img/colleague_tax_prediction_results.png" width="912" height="513" alt="" class="instructions_illustration">

        Each round corresponds to a
        working day in the game storyline. At the beginning of each round, you’ll fly to planet Zyxlon.
        This will happen automatically. You don’t have to do anything.</p>

    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Then you will choose whether to collect or discard five crystals, just like you practised earlier. Before you
        choose to collect or discard the fifth crystal, you’ll be asked to predict your taxes.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The rarer the crystals collected, the higher the taxes</li>
          <li>The taxes are a fixed percentage of the crystal score</li>
          <li class="correct">The higher the crystal score, the higher the taxes</li>

      <li class="expscreen">To accurately predict your tax payment, what should you do before moving to the tax prediction
        screen?
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate the average point value of the crystals collected that day</li>
          <li>Determine the rarity of the fifth crystal</li>
          <li class="correct">Decide whether you will collect or discard the fifth crystal</li>
          <li>Think about how many crystal points your colleagues usually collect</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="expscreen">Why is it important to decide whether to collect or discard the fifth crystal before
        predicting
        your tax payment?
        <ol>
          <li>Because the tax officer will ignore the fifth crystal when calculating your tax payment</li>
          <li class="correct">Because you need to know your final crystal score to estimate your tax payment, and this
            requires deciding if you’ll collect or discard the fifth crystal</li>
          <li>Because the tax officer will base your tax payment only on your decision to collect or discard the fifth
            crystal</li>
          <li>Because you need to know the rarity of the fifth crystal to predict your tax payment</li>
    
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="expscreen">How can you use the crystal score to predict the tax payment for yourself or one of your
        colleagues?
        <ol>
          <li>Assume that the tax payment will be a fixed percentage (e.g., 10&percnt;) of the crystal score</li>
          <li class="correct">Estimate the tax payment based on the patterns of previous payments and the principle that higher
            crystal scores generally lead to higher taxes</li>
          <li>Use the crystal score to calculate the exact tax payment using a fixed formula</li>
    
          <li>Simply use the same tax payment as the previous days, assuming that the tax officer will not change the
            amount
            very much</li>
    
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="expscreen">Why might you still have to pay taxes even if you collected zero crystal points on a given
        day?
        <ol>
    
          <li>The Intergalactic Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) requires a minimum daily contribution from all
            miners
            to fund their conservation efforts</li>
          <li>The tax officer randomly selects miners to pay a ‘lucky tax’ each day, which is independent of their crystal
            score</li>
          <li>There is an error in the tax calculation system that sometimes results in miners being charged taxes despite
            having no crystal points</li>
          <li class="correct">The tax officer charges a daily fee for the right to mine on Zyxlon, regardless of the
            number of
            crystals
            collected</li>
    
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="expscreen">Based on the general principle of the tax system, which miner is likely to pay <strong>more</strong> in taxes
        for
        a
        given day?
        <ol>
          <li class="correct">Miner Zane Orion, who collected crystals worth a total of 100 points</li>
          <li>Miner Avery Solstice, who collected crystals worth a total of 75 points</li>
          <li>Miner Remy Nova, who collected crystals worth a total of 50 points</li>
    
    
          <li>All miners will pay the same amount in taxes, regardless of their daily crystal score</li>
    
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="expscreen">Based on the general principle of the tax system, which miner is likely to pay <strong>less</strong> in taxes
        for
        a

        <ol>
          <li>Miner Zane Orion, who collected crystals worth a total of 100 points</li>
          <li>Miner Avery Solstice, who collected crystals worth a total of 75 points</li>
          <li class="correct">Miner Remy Nova, who collected crystals worth a total of 50 points</li>
    
    
          <li>All miners will pay the same amount in taxes, regardless of their daily crystal score</li>
    
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="expscreen">If two miners, Celestine and Sirius, have the exact same crystal score for the day, will their taxes be
        calculated differently?
        <ol>
          <li>The tax officer will definitely charge Celestine and Sirius the exact same tax because they don’t play favorites</li>
          <li>The tax officer will charge Celestine a lower tax than Sirius because Celestine has worked for C3 longer</li>
          <li class="correct">The tax officer has no way to tell Celestine and Sirius apart, but their taxes will likely be
            different because tax calculations are a bit unpredictable</li>
          <li>The tax officer will purposely charge one of them a higher tax based on whose personal life they dislike more
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="expscreen">What should you prioritize when developing your overall strategy for the game?
        <ol>
          <li>Collecting the largest and most valuable crystals</li>
          <li>Minimizing taxes at all costs, even if it means discarding valuable crystals</li>
          <li class="correct">Balancing crystal collection and tax management to maximize your overall score</li>
          <li>Focusing solely on predicting your colleagues’ tax payments accurately</li>
    
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="expscreen">How can you adapt your strategy based on the information gained from the tax prediction
        mini-game?
        <ol>
          <li>By always collecting the crystals with the highest point value</li>
          <li class="correct">By adjusting your crystal collection based on the predicted tax implications</li>
          <li>By discarding crystals more frequently to minimize taxes</li>
    
          <li>By ignoring the information from the mini-game and focusing on collecting as many crystals as possible</li>
        </ol>
