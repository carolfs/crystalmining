    <!-- <li class="expscreen">
      <p>It is the year 2452, and you work as a space miner for a company called Cosmic Crystal Corp (C3). Every day you fly to planet Zyxlon in search of alien crystals.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/sky_planet.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">

    </li> -->
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>It is the year 2452. As an employee of the renowned Cosmic Crystal Corp (C3), your mission is to fly every day to planet Zyxlon to collect the most valuable and powerful healing crystals in the galaxy.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>These crystals, coveted across the universe for their extraordinary healing properties, are sold on the
        Intergalactic Market, and C3 shares the profits with you.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Each working day, you’ll board your state-of-the-art spaceship, the Celestial Cruiser X9, and set course for
        Zyxlon.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>On your quest, you’ll encounter five unique crystals each day. Some crystals are small and delicate, emitting a
        soft, soothing glow, while others are massive and radiant, their facets reflecting the light of nearby stars.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Each crystal is worth a different number of points depending on their size and properties. You must choose which
        crystals to collect and which to discard.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Throughout the day, you’ll use your high-tech scanning device to keep track of the points you’ve earned from
        collecting crystals. The DISCARD box displays the total points you’ll have if you choose to discard the current
        crystal. In the example screen below, it’s 45 points.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The COLLECT box shows your updated total if you decide to add the crystal to your collection. Your overall score,
        displayed in the top left corner of your helmet’s heads-up display, represents your cumulative points across all
        working days.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>However, crystal mining is not without its challenges. The Intergalactic Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) has
        long been concerned about the impact of mining on the delicate ecosystems of Zyxlon.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To mitigate this harm, all miners are required to pay daily taxes based on the number of crystal points they’ve
        collected. Your local tax officer, a quirky and unpredictable character, is responsible for calculating taxes for
        all the miners at C3.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>While the general principle is that the more crystal points you collect, the higher your taxes will be, there is
        some variation in how the tax officer applies this rule. His methods are not entirely transparent, and he seems to
        enjoy adding a bit of randomness to the process, keeping miners on their toes.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You might find that your taxes are lower than expected on a day when you’ve collected a particularly large haul of
        crystals, while your colleague, with a similar collection, may end up paying more. The tax officer’s moods and whims
        can influence the tax rates, but only to a certain degree.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>After a long day of crystal hunting, you’ll have the chance to participate in the tax prediction mini-game, a
        favorite pastime among the miners of C3.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The tax prediction mini-game was born out of the shared experience of navigating the unpredictable tax system on
        planet Zyxlon. They reasoned that if they were going to be subject to the tax officer’s somewhat unpredictable
        decisions, they might as well make a game out of it.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>The tax prediction mini-game also serves a practical purpose, as it encourages miners to develop a better
        understanding of how the tax system works and make more informed decisions about their own mining strategies.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Using your knowledge of the crystal market and tax calculations, you’ll try to predict your own taxes and those of
        your colleagues. The more accurate your predictions are, the more points you’ll earn, up to 10 points per
        prediction.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Before you choose to collect or discard the fifth crystal of the day, you will be asked to predict your tax
        payment.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To do this, you’ll see the point value of the fifth crystal and what your total for the day will be if you choose
        to collect or discard it. When you see this screen, decide if you’ll collect this crystal or not.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Then, you’ll move to the tax prediction screen. Information about the fifth crystal will be at the top right of the
        screen, helping you predict the tax payment.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You can earn up to 10 points for predicting your taxes, and these points will be added to your overall score. The
        more accurate your prediction, the more points you will earn.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Next, you can also earn up to 10 points for predicting a colleague’s tax payment based on their crystal collection,
        and these points will be added to your overall score.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>To become the ultimate space miner and maximize your score, you’ll need to find the perfect balance between
        collecting valuable crystals and avoiding excessive taxes.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Study the patterns of your colleagues’ crystal collections and tax payments, and use this knowledge to refine your
        strategy. The key to success is to collect as many points as possible while keeping your taxes manageable, a
        delicate balance that requires skill, intuition, and a bit of cosmic luck.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol id="quiz-instructions" class="instructions">
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You have finished the tutorial. Now you can start a quiz on these instructions. Make sure you have carefully read and understood these instructions before starting the quiz.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/space_start.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol id="game-instructions" class="instructions">
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You have finished the quiz. Well done! Now you know how to travel to planet Zyxlon, collect crystals, and predict how many points your boss will give you as a bonus.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/sky_planet.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/greeting_astronaut.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Next, you’ll play the game for <span class="constant NUM_TRIALS"></span> rounds. Each round corresponds to a working day in the game storyline. At the beginning of each round, you’ll buy a spaceship ticket for 100 points and fly to planet Zyxlon. This will happen automatically. You don’t have to press any keys.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/sky_planet.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/spaceship_ticket.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Then you will choose whether to collect or discard five crystals, just like you practised earlier. Before you choose to collect or discard the fifth crystal, you’ll be asked to predict your bonus.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/bonus_prediction_screen.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>You can earn up to 20 points for your bonus prediction, so put your best guess forward.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/bonus_prediction_screen.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Afterwards, you’ll find out how many bonus points your boss gave you and how many points you earned from your bonus prediction.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/bonus_screen.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Remember that if you get too greedy and earn too many points from collecting crystals in a single day, your boss might suspect you are involved in illegal and environmentally harmful mining practices, so he might give you a small or even negative bonus.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/boss.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>Your boss knows crystal mining is hard and sometimes you can only find small crystals to collect. He doesn’t care if you earned too few points in a day. He only cares if you earned too many.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/boss.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>So, to get a good bonus from your boss and achieve a high score in this game, consider leaving some crystals behind.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/crystal_collect.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/arrow_discard.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>However, remember that your boss can be quite unpredictable and might increase or decrease your bonus for ridiculous reasons.</p>
      <img src="/crystalmining/img/boss.png" width="912" height="513" alt="">
    </li>
    <li class="expscreen">
      <p>At the end of the game, your overall score will be converted into pounds and added to your payment.</p>
